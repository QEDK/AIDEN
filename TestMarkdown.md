## üî• Your Pitch
Air Pollution is a major talking point and has certainly created havoc in the Delhi NCR region.
Air pollution causes respiratory problems, everyone is quite aware of this fact and most of the citizens are taking measures for this by using air masks. But not everyone knows that it also causes skin problems, the PM2 particles present in the air can cause a lot of skin problems like Skin Cancer. 
Skin cancer is often overlooked, as it is can appear to be similar to a lot of skin diseases. If it is overlooked it can become very potent. 
We built a machine learning model to detect if a skin sample has cancer or not using Azure Cognitive Services
We deployed a web application using Azure Pipeline and Virtual machine to upload an image of the skin sample. 
It gives prediction % of the possibility of that skin sample to have cancer.
Web app was made using Javascript and Bootstrap
The server side is written in C# which is deployed using Azure Pipeline and connected to the github repository
It calls the API end point of Azure Custom Vision AI to predict results on the image
And displays the result on the web app
